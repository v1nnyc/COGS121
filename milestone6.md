* **Intro Screen** -- We added the Google Maps API  so it shows the UC San Diego map in the background.

* **Map Screen** -- We added the ability to see the marker hover when hovering over a list item. The map is our data visualization. It displays markers of the items on the list view next to the map. There is now also a animation between the switching filters.

* **Map Screen Toggle** -- This is an example of the filtering function. We switch to display the list fastest rather than closest. This change is also reflected in the map.
