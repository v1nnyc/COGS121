#Simple map / location based

![Title Screen](/prototype 2 title screen.png)
* **Title Screen** -- This is what a user would see the first time they view the site.
![Map](/prototype 2 map.png)
* **Map Screen** -- This screen would show recent wifi speeds for UCSD protected network and UCSD guest. Users would be able to see their current location in relation to the wifi speeds. The different colors represent different wifi speeds. We are also considering using a heat map API so the map looks less cluttered.
![Add Data](/prototype 2 add data.png)
* **Add Your Data** Screen -- This pop up window would allow users to add their current internet speeds and which network theyâ€™re on to our data. We will use an internet speed API to gather this data.
