# Simple map / location based

![Title Screen](/milestone_images/MOCK1-1.png)
* **Title Screen** -- This is what a user would see the first time they view the site.
![Map](/milestone_images/MOCK1-2.png)
* **Map Screen** -- This screen would show recent wifi speeds for UCSD protected network and UCSD guest. Users would be able to see their current location in relation to the wifi speeds. The different colors represent different wifi speeds. We are also considering using a heat map API so the map looks less cluttered.
![Add Data](/milestone_images/MOCK1-3.png)
* **Add Your Data** Screen -- This pop up window would allow users to add their current internet speeds and which network they’re on to our data. We will use an internet speed API to gather this data. 

# Yelp for wifi
![Search Screen](/milestone_images/MOCK2-1.png)
* **Search Screen**  -- Users will be able to search the wifi speeds for specific buildings and floors of buildings. We’re also considering changing the search feature from searching for specific locations to searching for good wifi spots near the user’s current location.
![Research Results Screen](/milestone_images/MOCK2-1.png)
* **Search Results Screen**  -- This screen displays the results of the average wifi speeds for each building and floor of the building, so that users can get more detailed information on wifi upload and download speeds.
