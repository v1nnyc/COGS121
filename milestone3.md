* **Map Screen** -- This screen would show recent wifi speeds for UCSD protected network and UCSD guest. Users would be able to see their current location in relation to the wifi speeds. The different colors represent different wifi speeds. This looks similar to our original prototype but we added a filter at the top to make it easier for users to understand the different WiFi connectivity.

* **Add Your Data** -- This pop up (functionality will be added later) window would allow users to add their current internet speeds and which network theyâ€™re on to our data. We will use an internet speed API to gather this data. This is similar to our original prototype.
