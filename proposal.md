Proposal:

One of our ideas is to develop a web application to track wifi speeds and connection strength based on collected geolocations of users throughout the UCSD campus. Our goal would be to develop a heat map or some other type of visualization to display this information.

Another idea is to utilize one of the data.gov datasets in order to develop an interactive data platform. One of the potential data sets is https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/city-of-seattle-wages-comparison-by-gender-all-job-classifications-e471a/resource/d1ffa64f-ef2b-4674-9c30-5e94bc241bc0 which shows the income disparities between males and females in the Seattle area.
